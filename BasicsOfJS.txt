JS was developed by Brendan Eich in 1915 AD in just 10 days.
JS was initial called Mocha.
Later it was called Livescript.
Brendan Eich was working in Netscape Commnuniation Co-Operation.
At that time Java was the most famous programming language which was under sun microsystem.
Late on Netscape and microsystem did partnership with each other.
Later on Livescript was named JS(JavaScript).
Note: Java and JavaScript are totally different programming language.
There was competition between Netscape navigator and microsoft internet explorer.
microsoft internet explorer also developed JScript.
There was collision between these browser it means if one projcet is working fit and fine in one browser but the same project is not working in another browser.
Due to this collision Netscape wants to make a ecosystem and take their JavaScript to ecma to for standarization.
In 2009 ryan dahl developed a nodejs which lets js to run in server.
